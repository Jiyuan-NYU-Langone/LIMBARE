LIMBARE: an Advanced Linear Mixed-effects Breakpoint Analysis with Robust Estimation Method

Broken stick analysis is a widely used approach for detecting unknown breakpoints where the association between measurements is nonlinear. LIMBARE accommodates data with complex dependencies such as repeated measurements over time, and clustering (inter-eyes correlation), and it effectively addresses the presence of outliers.
